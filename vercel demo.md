To deploy a web application, the process can follow a structured order. First, push your project code to a Git repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. If using Vercel, you simply connect your Git repo to the Vercel dashboard, and it will automatically build and deploy your app, giving you a live URL like project.vercel.app. On the other hand, if you are setting up your own server (for example, in Washington DC), you begin by creating the server instance and noting its public IP address. Next, connect to the server securely using SSH (ssh user@ip). Once logged in, install a web server such as Nginx or Apache, which will handle incoming requests. After that, pull your application code from Git onto the server (git clone <repo-url>), place the build files in the server’s web directory (e.g., /var/www/html), and restart the service. At this point, your application is accessible through the server’s IP address and can be mapped to a custom domain name via DNS. This ordered approach ensures smooth deployment, whether you rely on Vercel for automation or prefer manual deployment with SSH and web servers.
we link url or git to versel app the process build and deployment in AI   . versel redirected through ssh ,ami in server which server IP webserver(apache,httpd.nginx) select server   and build package  already installed in it  then deplyoment   ip settings   portno settingss ,then change ip to url domain   domain name to website, that is CI/CD  pipeline
AI tool for CI/CD  is vercel
