## Basic Jenkins Interview Questions

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) by automating build, test, and deployment processes. It supports a wide range of plugins for integration with various tools and is highly extensible for DevOps workflows.

1. What is Jenkins?  
   Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used for building, testing, and deploying software projects continuously.

2. Why is Jenkins popular in DevOps?  
   Jenkins is popular due to its flexibility, extensive plugin ecosystem, and support for automating CI/CD pipelines, enabling faster software delivery.

3. What are the key features of Jenkins?  
   Key features include distributed build support, plugin architecture, easy installation, and pipeline as code for defining workflows.

4. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?  
   Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.

5. What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?  
   Continuous Delivery automates the release process so that software can be deployed to production at any time with minimal manual intervention.

6. How do you install Jenkins?  
   Jenkins can be installed by downloading the WAR file and running it with Java, or using package managers like apt for Ubuntu or brew for macOS.

7. What is a Jenkins job or project?  
   A Jenkins job is a configurable entity that defines how to build, test, and deploy a specific software project.

8. What is the role of the Jenkinsfile?  
   The Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline, enabling pipeline as code stored in version control.

9. What are Jenkins plugins?  
   Plugins extend Jenkins functionality, such as integrating with Git, Docker, or cloud services, with over 1,800 available.

10. How does Jenkins integrate with version control systems?  
    Jenkins integrates with systems like Git via plugins, polling for changes or using webhooks to trigger builds automatically.

## Intermediate Jenkins Interview Questions

Jenkins pipelines allow defining the entire CI/CD process as code, supporting both declarative and scripted syntax for complex workflows. Nodes in Jenkins refer to agents or masters where builds execute, enabling distributed processing.

11. What is a Jenkins pipeline?  
    A Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating CI/CD workflows using code.

12. What is the difference between declarative and scripted pipelines?  
    Declarative pipelines use a structured syntax for simplicity, while scripted pipelines offer more flexibility with Groovy scripting.

13. What is a Jenkins agent or node?  
    An agent or node is a machine that connects to the Jenkins controller to execute build jobs, supporting master-slave architecture.

14. How do you configure build triggers in Jenkins?  
    Build triggers can be set via polling SCM, webhooks, or scheduled cron-like syntax to automate job execution.

15. What is the purpose of the workspace in Jenkins?  
    The workspace is a directory on the agent where the source code is checked out and builds are performed.

16. How does Jenkins handle credentials?  
    Jenkins uses a credentials store with plugins to securely manage secrets like API keys or passwords for integrations.

17. What is a multibranch pipeline?  
    A multibranch pipeline automatically creates jobs for each branch in a repository, ideal for Git workflows with pull requests.

18. How do you parallelize stages in a Jenkins pipeline?  
    Use the 'parallel' directive in declarative pipelines to run multiple stages simultaneously for faster execution.

19. What is the Blue Ocean interface in Jenkins?  
    Blue Ocean is a visual plugin that provides an intuitive UI for creating and managing pipelines with a focus on user experience.

20. How do you manage Jenkins backups?  
    Use the Backup plugin or manually back up the JENKINS_HOME directory, which stores configurations, jobs, and plugins.

## Advanced Jenkins Interview Questions

Advanced Jenkins features include integrating with Kubernetes for dynamic agents and using shared libraries for reusable pipeline code. Security in Jenkins involves role-based access and integrating with LDAP for authentication.

21. What are shared libraries in Jenkins?  
    Shared libraries are Groovy-based repositories that allow reusing pipeline code across multiple jobs, promoting modularity.

22. How do you integrate Jenkins with Kubernetes?  
    Use the Kubernetes plugin to dynamically provision pods as agents for scalable, ephemeral build environments.

23. What is the role of Groovy in Jenkins pipelines?  
    Groovy is the scripting language used to define pipeline logic, enabling dynamic behaviors in scripted pipelines.

24. How do you secure Jenkins?  
    Secure Jenkins by enabling authentication, using matrix-based authorization, and integrating with LDAP or SSO providers.

25. What is the Jenkins controller?  
    The controller (formerly master) manages jobs, agents, and configurations, while delegating build execution to agents.

26. How do you handle artifacts in Jenkins?  
    Use the ArtifactArchiver step to store build outputs, which can then be promoted or downloaded in later stages.

27. What are webhooks in Jenkins?  
    Webhooks are HTTP callbacks from SCM like GitHub that trigger Jenkins builds on code pushes or pull requests.

28. How do you scale Jenkins for large teams?  
    Scale by adding multiple agents, using cloud plugins for dynamic provisioning, and implementing load balancing across controllers.

29. What is the difference between freestyle and pipeline jobs?  
    Freestyle jobs offer a UI-based configuration for simple tasks, while pipeline jobs use code for complex, versioned workflows.

30. How do you troubleshoot a failed Jenkins build?  
    Check console output, logs in JENKINS_HOME, plugin versions, and agent connectivity to identify issues like dependency failures or permission errors.
