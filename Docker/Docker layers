# Docker Layers

- **FROM:** Creates the base image layer(s) (e.g., `FROM ubuntu:latest`). This is the foundation of your image.

- **WORKDIR:** Creates a layer to set the working directory for subsequent instructions.

- **APP:** Refers to the topmost layer of a container image that contains your application code and its dependencies.

- **RUN:** Creates a new layer for every command execution (e.g., package installation like `apt-get install`, building code).  
  

- **ADD / COPY:** Creates a layer for adding files or directories from the host to the image.  
 

- **EXPOSE:** Declares which port the container will listen on at runtime.
