# What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp.  
It is used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
we can define, manage, and automate cloud infrastructure using simple configuration files

# Infrastructure Lifecycle

Traditionally, infrastructure was **long-lived and mutable**, meaning servers and resources were created once and then manually updated or changed over time.  

now, infrastructure is **short-lived and immutable**.  
Instead of modifying existing servers, we **destroy and recreate** them with the updated configuration whenever needed.  
This ensures consistency, reduces errors, and makes deployments faster and more reliable.


## Terraform Step

**terraform init** - Sets up Terraform in your project and downloads provider plugins.

**terraform plan** - Shows what changes will be made before applying.  
                     here,  
                     "+" shows changes that is added  
                     "-" shows changes that is removed

**terraform apply** - Builds or modifies infrastructure as defined in code.

## The standard format of terraform code is

```hcl
resource "<RESOURCE_TYPE>" "<RESOURCE_LOCAL_NAME>" {
  # ...
}

## Terraform Example:

'''hcl
resource "local_file" "test_file" {
  filename = "test.txt"         
  content  = "Azure is great"  

Resource Type: local_file (Manages files on the local filesystem)
Local Name: test_file (A name you choose)

# Terraform tfstate

The **Terraform state file**  is a file that keeps track of all the resources Terraform manages.  

When we run Terraform commands like `plan` or `apply`, Terraform will  Reads the `tfstate` file to know what resources already exist, and Compares it with  configuration files and decides what needs to be created, updated, or destroyed.
The `terraform.tfstate` file is created automatically after running `terraform apply`
